# Regular tests
#
# Use this to ensure your tests are passing on every push and PR (skipped on
# pushes which only affect documentation).
# There is also a cron job set to run weekly on the default branch, to check
# against dependency chain rot.
#
# You should make sure you run jobs on at least the *oldest* and the *newest*
# versions of python that your codebase is intended to support.
